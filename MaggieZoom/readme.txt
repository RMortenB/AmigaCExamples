MaggieZoom

Small example in C of how you can set up MAGGIE on the V4.
It shows a simple rotozooming image of a rather handsome owl.

I've only tested this with Bebbos gcc6.5, but could work with other compilers. Should be close, anyway.

The owl texture lives in own.c, and the rest of the code all lives in main.c

Maggie.h is NOT a canonical header; something proper may turn up one of these days.
